  - NodeJS (https://nodejs.org), 
  - TailwindCSS (https://tailwindcss.com), and 
  - ReactJS (https://reactjs.org).

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on building an experimental economics system where everyone can build a permissionless space to work together without depending on centralized authority. (It can be an idea or concept, algorithm, flowchart, or code)
