### Welcome to My Laboratory

![dwebonewversion](/public/ghbanner.png)



- 🔭 I’m currently working on myself. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Handshake:
-- (P2P Root Naming System and Certificate Authority | https://handshake.org), NodeJS, TailwindCSS, and ReactJS.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on building an experimental economics system where everyone can build a permissionless space to work together without depending on centralized authority. (It can be an idea or concept, algorithm, flowchart, or code)
- 💬 My hobbies (illustrating, playing music, learning neuroscience, gaming, and doing social experiments).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am obsessed with patterns, permissionless systems, micropreneurship, and digital assets.
- 💻 I'm more interested in freelancing work than 9-to-5 work. (Even though freelancing can sometimes make me work 9-to-9. LoL)
- 🤝 My HNS Top-Level Domain (TLD) Portfolio: https://www.niami.io/p/b97bb30c678c350d7c6160512d16e8d7 (Feel free to make some offers to buy my domains)

I made a PDF and ODT version of Handshake Project Design Notes (Think of it like the whitepaper).
